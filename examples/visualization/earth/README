This example demonstrates how to display some part of the Earth in a simulation.
This example requires the OSG Earth support of OMNeT++ 5.0 or later.

In fact, the example doesn't contain any communication related modules such as
network nodes. It only contains two toplevel modules: a geographic coordinate
system, and a visualizer. This example also demonstrates that network nodes are
not essential for such a visualization.

When you run the example, you should see the detailed map of Boston downtown.
