This example demonstrates how to display physical objects present in the
physical environment. The physical objects are defined in a separate XML file.

In fact, the example doesn't contain any communication related modules such as
network nodes. It only contains two toplevel modules: a physical environment,
and a visualizer of this physical environment. This example also demonstrates
that network nodes are not essential for such a visualization.

When you run the example, you should see a simple apartment that has three rooms
and a few windows.
