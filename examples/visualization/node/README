This example demonstrates how to display external 3D models for network nodes.
This example requires the OSG support of OMNeT++ 5.0 or later.

The example contains a number of standard hosts. In fact, the network nodes
don't communicate at all, because it's not essential in this example.

When you run the example, you should see a number of very simple 3D animated
humanoid objects. They represent the nodes in the network.
