This example demonstrates how to display obstacle loss that happens during radio
signal propagation. Obstacle loss is twofold: dielectric loss is caused by the
object's material, reflection loss is caused by entering and leaving the object.  

The example uses an ad-hoc wireless network that consists of 2 nodes. The source
node continuously pings the destination node through a simple cuboid physical
wall. Both nodes move up and down but they always stay at the opposite sides of
the wall.

When you run the example, the obstacle loss visualizer displays the intersections
with the radio signal propagation path and the physical object. It also shows
the face normal vectors for the intersection where the signal enters and leaves
the object.
